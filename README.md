To set server running run server_test.py.

Clients are run by invoking make_post.py. After entering a username (at the
moment users John, Nobby and Emma are defined) you can use the commands:
`request_location' to request locations of all users

`set_location' to set your location. When you do this a post gets sent to all
other clients updating them on your location.
